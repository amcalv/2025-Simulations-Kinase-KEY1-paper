Solves the 2D continuum model of unphosphorylated (sticky) and phosphorylated (non-sticky) EPYC1 in a geometry mimicking the shape of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast, using finite elements with no-flux boundary conditions. The system follows a three-component Floryâ€“Huggins free energy describing EPYC1 and solvent interactions, and the switching rates between the two EPYC1 states are spatially uniform and depend only on time.
